# Identify Customer Segments

## Unsupervised Learning - Udacity IMLND 


## Description


In this project, I used unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.



## Data 

The files used in the project:

- `Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv` : Demographic data for the general population of Germany.
- `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv` : Demographic data for customers of a mail-order company.
- `Data_Dictionary.md` : Information file about the features in the provided datasets.
- `AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv` : Summary of feature attributes for demographic data.
